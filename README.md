this was originally supposed to be a fractal thing, but I don't remember what happened and it suddenly became this Aurora Borealis looking thing heh

Here's a guide for the -4 people who care:

The buttons you see in the Formula section change the way the shape is drawn each time per frame. 
The top section controls the X axis and the bottom controls the Y axis. 

In the Tweak section, the intensity controls how much of an effect the selected formulas will have on the shape. 

The "size" section is the size multiplier for each time the shape is drawn: Size Ã— 0.95 (default).
You can also make the value greater than one for a growing effect.
Keep in mind that a value very close to one or exactly equal to one will cause to much recursion and will not work. 

Have fun!!
